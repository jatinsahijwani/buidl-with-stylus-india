# 🇮🇳 HackTour India: Arbitrum Web3 Workshop Series

Welcome to the official repository of **HackTour India – Arbitrum Edition** 🚀

This repository is a public, open-source space where we are:
- Documenting our **learning journey** of the Arbitrum ecosystem (including Stylus)
- **Preparing workshop content and code examples** for our nationwide university tour
- **Creating multilingual educational content** to enable grassroots Web3 adoption across India
- Sharing our progress transparently with the Arbitrum DAO and global dev community

## 🎯 Objective

Our mission is to educate **5,000+ Indian students and developers** across **50+ cities** about the Arbitrum ecosystem, Layer 2 scaling, smart contract development, and the power of Stylus — using **interactive workshops**, **live demos**, and **regional language content**.

We aim to onboard the next generation of Web3 builders by:
- Providing foundational to advanced technical education
- Promoting ecosystem contributions to Arbitrum
- Empowering communities across India to innovate onchain
